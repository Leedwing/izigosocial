## 2. CSS
1. Zero out everything
To ensure that elements don't have any style at creation so that we don't expiriment unexpected behavior when styling
```
*, *::before *::after {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    outline: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    text-decoration: none;
    list-style: none;
    border: none;
}
```
